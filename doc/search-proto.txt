= Protocol of (/api/search)

== Search By Name
=== Request Format
{
	"cat" : "byname",
	"matcher" : "regex",
	"pattern" : <pattern string>,
	"sortby" : <reserved>,
	"start" : <reserved>,
	"number" : <reserved>
};

Currently we only support regular expressions (regex). Wildchar will be added
later.

sortby will be supported later.
start and number are reserved for partial content request. 

"pattern" cannot be empty for now, since partial request has not been
implemented.

=== Response format
{
	"cat" : "search result",
	"result" : "OK"/"OK Partial",
	"reason" : <optional for error reason>,
	"start" : <reserved>,
	"items" : [
		{
			"filename" : <file name>,
			"path" : <path to the directory>,
			"size" : <file size>, // Optional
			"mtime" : <modified time> // Optional
		},
		...
	]
};

Note:
1. Naming convention of "path"
	- "path" must start with "/" for files on all mounted volumes.
	- For files on offline volumes, "path" must start with the unique
	  tracking ID (trID) of the volume.
	- "path" must use "/" as separator, even under windows.
